title: Digital Transformation - Darwinian View of an Enterprise-IT Organization
published: true
---

I started this post with curiosity on - what would a typical IT
 Organization in an Enterprise play for the digital transformation. 
 Normally traditional IT Organizations in an Enterprise plays a 
 back-office, cost-center role supporting business - developing 
 applications (products as we now call it fancifully!) against business 
 requirements, supporting ERP systems, COTS packages that are aligned to business. As we all know
  this can no more be the case as we witness the disruptions and 
  transformations in the world today all enabled by digital. Who on 
  earth would have thought bricks-and-mortar Toys "R" Us would lose 
  sales to online Amazon and eventually close down. Moral - Adapt/Digitize or Perish!
  
The post is to provide an outline with an evolutionary view 
(Darwinism) of how a typical IT Organization in an Enterprise can change
 to enable the digital transformation. Enterprise - here in context is 
 probably a company or a corporation that act as a single 
entity for that business; Organization - here in 
context is a group (of people) within the Enterprise with a particular 
purpose (IT Organization would provide IT/Technology 
support/services for the Enterprise). The post provides the point of view from the 
IT development model rather than technology enablers for
digital-transformation like Analytics, Cloud, AI/ML, IoT etc.
   
## What is digital?
The word "digital" is a loaded word and could mean many things - 
contextualizing to the current subject on a customer-centric 
enterprise would mean - technology to improve performance and 
the reach the enterprise has.

## What is digital transformation?
Digital transformation is the integration of technology in all areas 
of business fundamentally changing how the enterprise would operate 
and deliver value to the customers. 

More than technology, digital transformation is about 
culture - challenge the existing state of affairs, change existing 
ways of working, be nimble, be transparent, experiment, comfortable 
with failures. All of these centered around delivering value and 
unlock potential areas of customer requirements and satisfaction.

A good comprehensive view of digital transformation in an Enterprise 
and the key areas is articulated in an Opinion and Analysis Paper - 
[The Nine Elements of Digital Transformation](https://sloanreview.mit
.edu/article/the-nine-elements-of-digital-transformation/) published 
by MIT Sloan. The article describes 3 key-areas/pillars subsequently 
3 elements within to describe transformation. 

Not to repeat - in a gist the 3 pillars in simple description would 
be:- 
1. Customer Experience: e.g. Enhanced and targeted customer 
engagements; retailer "Walmart" enhances shopping experience with a shopping assistant in the mobile-app by providing the store-map based on the list the customer has! 
2. Operational Processes: e.g. Process digitization; 
apparel companies digitizing the design process was able to move away
 from physically shipping prototypes across design centers shortening
  product development life-cycle.
3. Business Model: New Markets
 e.g. Airline industry offering E2E travel experience right from 
 reservation, traffic, pick-up at door step, lodging - a complete 
 journey!
 
Adding to this is my view that the foundation of these pillars ought 
to be the  existing  - "IT Organization" - illustrated as below.

There is no one way for digital transformation and needless to say it
 would be attributed to what the enterprise wants to achieve based on
  the vision - the goals (desired outcomes) and objectives(targets to
   achieve the goals). A strategy of one is not going to be applicable for another.
 
While the post talks about digital transformation - the primary focus
 of this post is how an "IT Organization" can change to support these 
 pillars. IT Organization in my view is the foundation for the pillars to be 
strong, supportive and effect change.

## Foundation - IT Organization 
IT Organizations need to transform - and transformation as we know is 
about changing things and that could be something like below or 
anything that is pertinent to the organization
* New Architecture
* New Technology
* New processes & ways of working

One of the fundamental things to note is to align this with - what 
the enterprise wants to achieve (the vision, goals and objectives).

So what would be the change from IT Org perspective? "It depends". 
* "As a goal - business says I will provide new business logic 
that were not part of the product but would like to get them to 
users in minutes time" and IT Org could achieve this with "Ability to
 commit code and move-to-production in minutes and during any 
 time of the day". As an example [Netflix can deploy code from commit->prod in 16 mins](https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/03/How-Netflix-Builds-Code/).

## Orchestrating change - Darwinism

Adapt or Perish : Rather than react to change or be disrupted - IT 
Organization should invest in transformation to adapt & support the 
digital transformation of the Enterprise (see the 3 pillars above) --
 else the Enterprise on a whole will be out-performed and eventually 
 perish!.
 
This is the reason for the topic to call it with "Darwinism" - "the 
theory of evolution of species by natural selection" where  
adaptation is of utmost importance rather than the fittest. 
Enterprises that adapt to new environment would be the ones that 
would be naturally selected for future.

How would we effect change? While it is easy for start-ups as they can align technology and 
process to business strategy the problem is with 'legacy organizations' where existing structures impede the transformation like 

* Existing technology & application landscape that are not so nimble
* Current org-team structure that have defined responsibilities
* Current application-life-cycle process & associated tools, 
technologies and structures: dev-build-test-release
* Varied visions of departments in the organization
* Existing technology debts

The **change** is best done in an evolving fashion "Darwinism" 
 -- with **continuum** as the key fundamental principle.

In **summary** - digital transformation for an IT Organization is about 
what the Enterprise wants to achieve - vision, the goals and 
objectives and the best possible way is to evolve supported by 
cultural change and aligning with principles like - 
experimentation is good, be transparent, be bold, failure happens and
 it s okay (but we try to fail fast) and from a team-culture 
perspective it might also be good to look at [leadership principles 
of Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) tailor it, make 
it fit-for-purpose and effect change. We know it works for them and 
it might for any other as well and after-all who does not 
want to be like 'Amazon'!
